**ðŸŽ¶ Music Genre Classification â€“ GTZAN Dataset******

This project implements a Music Genre Classifier using the GTZAN dataset.
The goal is to automatically classify music tracks into different genres (e.g., classical, jazz, rock, pop, etc.) using machine learning/deep learning techniques.
**
ðŸ“‚** Dataset â€“ GTZAN****

The GTZAN dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for music genre classification.
It contains 1,000 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long, across 10 genres:
blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock

**Dataset source: GTZAN on Kaggle

ðŸš€ Features

Extracts Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and other audio features.
Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) / traditional ML classifiers to identify music genres.
Data preprocessing with Keras ImageDataGenerator (or librosa for feature extraction).
Train/validation split for model evaluation.
